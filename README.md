#Walk through the Repo for all the details

In order to use the application , first register a user using Resigter API
Since the application has not hoisted or deployed anywhere, use your local IP
http://your_ip/auth/api/users/register

After registering a user, login the user replacing {register} to {login} in the above URL 

Once you have successfully Logged in , you will get a JWT Token , and it will provide you the access to go through the application.
